    <h6>Growing up, I had always desired to attend the University of Georgia for my college career, however I must say I had no clue what for. My interest's varied from marine biology to veterinarian sciences (just to play with puppies)as I aged throughout my childhood. Upon ending my highschool years, I came to the realization business was what I wanted to pursue. In some way or the other, all fields require an aspect of business to function. Between this and my love for working with others, I chose to strive torwards a business management degree. </h6>
	<p> I've learned a multitutde of skills within my two years at UGA so far; both of which have flown by. Some of these lessons include;
			<ul>
				<li> time management</li>
				<li> flexibility </li>
				<li> consideration</li>
			</ul>
		The list stretches on and on and will continue to as I finish the second half of my college career here.
