    <h1>Chick-fil-A</h1>
    <p>	Beginning as just another high school team member midst my junior year, I started my journey with what would soon become a passion of a lifetime. I quickly climbed my way up the totem pole, as I thrived in this new-friendly business environment. My operator, the owner of my free standing unit of which I was employeed, soon my noticed my potential and began pouring into me his business insight. I have been quite fortunate for all the competitive oppurtunites this corporation has presented me with. At just age 18, I had become a certified corporate trainer, ServSafe certified, performed as an operations manager, and served at a Grand Opening for a new Chick-fil-A unit in Fort Worth, TX. I am extremely passionate for all that this company stands for while still performing at an extremely economic level. I hope to become an operator myself come my conclusion of my undergraduate degree.</p>
