    <h1><span STYLE="font-weight: bolder">Sigma Kappa Sorority</span></h1>
    <p>Sigma Kappa is a panhellenic sorority composed of roughly 300 women within the Epsilon Epsilon chapter at the University of Georgia. I had never considered going through the recruitment process until my summer orientation after the conclusion of my high school career. With this,  I procceded through with several other thousand young women until I found my home at Sigma Kappa. I have been fortunate enough to recieve many oppurtunities to grow academically and increase networking for my professional career. I served on our executive board as Historian, teaching me a multitude of lasting skills. </p>
